# Nth-Factorial-Sum-and-Average
This program inputs an integer value n and uses different JavaScript loop structures to compute three results: (1) the nth factorial using a while loop, (2) the sum of the first n numbers using a do-while loop, and (3) the average of the first n numbers using a for loop.
